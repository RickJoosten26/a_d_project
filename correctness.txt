First we create a class Box, which allows us to more easily work with the boxes and make it clearer on what we are working with. 

class Box {
	public: 
		double dim1, dim2, dim3;

		Box(double dimi1, double dimi2, double dimi3){
			vector<double> dims = {dimi1, dimi2, dimi3}; 
			sort(dims.begin(), dims.end()); 
			dim1 = dims.at(2); 
			dim2 = dims.at(1); 
			dim3 = dims.at(0); 
		}
}

We take the three dimensions that are given for a box, then we put those in a vector that we sort, so that dim1 will always be the biggest, 
dim2 the second and so on. This ensures
